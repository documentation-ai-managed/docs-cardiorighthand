title: Introduction to CardioRightHand
description: Discover the mysterious organization CardioRightHand, an SCP-like entity managing anomalous objects across various zones, structures, and subdivisions.

## Overview

CardioRightHand operates as a secretive organization dedicated to the containment, study, and utilization of anomalous objects. Similar to SCP Foundation protocols, you interact with a network of secure zones housing unpredictable entities, supported by specialized structures and subdivisions. Access the central dashboard at `https://dashboard.example.com` to begin exploring classified documentation and initiate containment procedures.

This documentation equips you with tools to query anomalies, navigate zones, and integrate with organizational APIs securely.

## Key Features

CardioRightHand provides robust capabilities for anomaly management:

## Quick Start

Get operational in minutes. Follow these steps to query your first anomalous object.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign Up" icon="user-plus">
    Create an account at `https://dashboard.example.com/signup`. Verify your identity via email.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Obtain API Key" icon="key">
    Generate your key from the dashboard settings. Store it securely as `YOUR_API_KEY`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Query an Object" icon="search">
    Use the API to fetch details on Object-001.

    <CodeGroup tabs="JavaScript,Python">
      ```javascript
      const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/v1/objects/001', {
        headers: {
          'Authorization': `Bearer ${YOUR_API_KEY}`
        }
      });
      const data = await response.json();
      console.log(data);
      ```
      ```python
      import requests
      headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {YOUR_API_KEY}'}
      response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/v1/objects/001', headers=headers)
      data = response.json()
      print(data)
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="tip">
  Replace `{YOUR_API_KEY}` with your actual key. Test in a sandbox environment first to avoid containment breaches.
